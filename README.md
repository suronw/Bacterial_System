# Bacterial system simulation in Processing

## Overview
This is a visualization and simulation of a project I worked on in 2007 during an internship through Cornell University's NNIN - National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network in the Wendy Thomas lab at the University of Washington programming cluster computer simulations of Escherichia coli bacterial adhesion models matching atomic force microscope experiments on the force mediation of fimbria protein unfolding from nanoscale bonds and their contribution to the catch bond behavior of the tip.

This processing program is a highly simplified model not using real world physics. It is simply an exercise to practice programming and create a visualization of the modeling that was done on the inspirational project. The original project was written in C++, ran multiple instances on cluster computers, and produced massive amounts of raw numerical data that was further processed using Matlab. No visual representations were made.

While I able to view the real world fluid flow experiments that these simulations were modeling, I always wondered what the simulation looked liked. So I created this processing program to visualize the simulations. I took many liberties omitting much of the physics code and real world data as well as simplifying and rescaling components. The end result of this program is more like a cartoon than a photo. But much like game programming, there is a blend of real world ideas with entertaining applications.

## Progress
This program is a work in progress. As a labor of love I have no timeline for its progress but as I make improvements, changes, and add features I will update this repository and README with more information.
